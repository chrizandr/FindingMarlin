This is the readme file for the game Finding Marvin.
Developed by Chris Andrew (chris.g14@iiits.in) and Santhoshini Reddy (santhoshini.g14@iiits.in) as part of the ACM Game Hackers Hackathon held on 22nd Oct 2016
The game represents the work done in 24 hours from 22/10/2106 6:00pm to 23/10/2016 6:00pm.

The following are the basic controls:

W - Move front
S - Move back
A - Turn Left
D - Turn Right
Space - Swim Up
Enter - Change Dialog

**Dialog is a little faulty and I recommend pressing Enter only after the entire text or dialogue has been printed on the screen

I hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed building it.
Chris and Santhoshini :)
